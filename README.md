# NW Eft
 Decompilation of the Eft library from NintendoWare for Cafe (Wii U) v1.11.0 (present in Mario Kart 8) and v1.14.5 (present in Super Mario Maker).  
 Differences between v1.11.0 and v1.14.5 are very minimal that they don't deserve separate branches each.  

# Goal
 The goal is to decompile the library in order to make research of it easier. Exact matching is not currently a priority.
